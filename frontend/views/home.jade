      | All you need to get started is this framework and an idea. With the simplicity of Node.js, the awesomeness of SQL and authentication courtesy of Passport.js you don't have to bother with boilerplate.

      | The purpose behind this project is to decrease the amount of boilerplate code that needs to be written in order to get an app or website off the ground. I really wanted to like noSQL databases but I really like the performance and scalability of SQL. I wanted to combine the best frameworks into a single project to be able to focus on more important aspects of projects, not just the setup and boilerplate of writing authentication. I really wanted a project that focused on using the best frameworks which meant choosing Sequelize.js, Passport.js and Bootstrap.

      | The aim of this project was to write very modular and extensible code in order for others to leverage it as they want. I've included 4 main routes for social authentication: Google+, Facebook, Twitter, and Github and made it fairly easy to add more. There is also an option for local authentication all of which leverage the fantastic Passport.js project. Feel free to get as deep into the code as you like, and checkout the setup pages for instructions to setup API keys for the various platforms as well as installation instructions.
